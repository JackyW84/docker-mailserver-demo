# Wrapper for 'sed -i': fail if file was not modified by sed and container was not restarted.
# Error output is surpressed, when container is restarted to avoid harmless error messages.
# Use "--strict" as first parameter, to fail regardless of the container state (fresh or restarted).

# When to use sedfile?
# Is a file change optional? --> use regular 'sed -i'
# Is a file change expected? --> use 'sedfile --strict -i'
# Is a file change only on the first container run expected? --> use 'sedfile -i'
